\usage{
n.fdr.oneway(fdr, pwr, theta, k, pi0.hat = "BH")

\arguments{
\item{fdr}{Desired FDR (scalar numeric)}

\item{pwr}{Power of single Î±-level test (scalar numeric)}

\item{theta}{sum of ((group mean - overall mean)/stdev)^2 across all groups for each hypothesis test (vector)}

\item{k}{the number of groups to be compared}

\item{pi0.hat}{Approximation method for null proportion}
}
\description{
