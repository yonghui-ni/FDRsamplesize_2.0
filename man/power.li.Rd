\title{Compute power for RNA-Seq experiments assuming poisson distribution}
\usage{
power.li(n, alpha, rho, mu0, w = 1, type = "w")
}
\arguments{
\item{n}{per-group sample size}

\item{alpha}{p-value threshold (scalar)}

\item{rho}{fold-change, usual null hypothesis is that rho=1 (vector)}

\item{mu0}{average count in control group}

\item{w}{ratio of the total number of reads mapped between the two groups}

\item{type}{type of test: "w" for Wald, "s" for score, "lw" for log-transformed Wald, "ls" for log-transformed score}
}
\value{
vector of power estimates for two-sided tests
}
\description{
Use the formula of Li et al (2013) to compute power for comparing RNA-seq expression across two groups assuming the Poisson distribution
}
\details{
This function computes the power for each of a series of two-sided tests defined by the input parameters. The power is based on the sample size formulas in equations (10-13) of Li et al (2013). Also, note that the null.effect is set to 1 in the examples because the usual null hypothesis is that the fold-change = 1.
}
\examples{
power.li(88, 0.05, 1.25, 5, 0.5,"w") # recapitulate 80\% power in Table 1 of Li et al (2013)'
