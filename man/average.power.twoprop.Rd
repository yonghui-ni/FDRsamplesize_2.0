\title{Computer average power of many two proportion z-tests}
\usage{
average.power.twoprop(n, alpha, p1, p2, alternative)
}
\arguments{
\item{n}{per-group sample size (scalar)}

\item{alpha}{p-value threshold (scalar)}

\item{p1}{probability in one group (vector)}

\item{p2}{probability in other group (vector)}

\item{alternative}{one- or two-sided test}
}
\value{
Average power estimate for multiple testing procedure
}
\description{
Computer average power of many two proportion z-tests.The power calculation of two proportion z-test is based on asymptotic normal approximation.
}
\examples{
set.seed(1234);
p1 = sample(seq(0,0.5,0.1),40,replace = TRUE);
p2 = sample(seq(0.5,1,0.1),40,replace = TRUE);
average.power.twoprop(n = 30, alpha = 0.05, p1 = p1,p2 = p2,alternative="two.sided")
